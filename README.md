# QuestEyes-ClientSimulator
Device simulator for QuestEyes, for developmental purposes.
This software emulates a QuestEyes device on the network to be used to develop QuestEyes-Server without direct access to the hardware.

This is mostly created so that QuestEyes can be developed without needing to use the device repeatedly while in a rapid development phase.
